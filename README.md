You will need to run 2 files which are included in the given repository. First run the “MarkingServer.exe”, this will be needed to test our CPU Emulator program.

Now to run the emulator through tests in the “Emulator.exe” CMD window enter “T” and hit enter to run the emulator through testing with the marking server. The programs will use loop back sockets to communicate between each other ports used (server 6532 and 6533).
